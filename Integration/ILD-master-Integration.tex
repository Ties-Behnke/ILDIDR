\chapter{ILD Global Integration}
%\writer{Karsten Buesser, Claude Vallee}
\label{chap:integration}

This chapter is devoted to the diverse matters of global interest for the ILD integration, assembly and operation. These include the integration of the detector and its services within the experimental hall, the integration of subdetectors as a coherent detector, the mechanical behaviour of its components and mitigation of seismic movements, the design of the main magnet with its coil and iron yoke, mitigation of beam-related background, calibration strategies and data acquisition. All these topics still require a large amount of studies to finalise the ILD engineering design in its operational environment. There was however significant progress over the past years and the current status is summarised in the following sections.
