\fix{dE/dx, potentially ToF, shower shapes}

Figure~\ref{fig:perf:trkeff_jer_dedx} shows the separation power for $\pi/K$ and $K/p$  based on the $dE/dx$ measurement in the TPC (left) and the
possible improvement that could be achieved by combining it with a  {\em time-of-flight (TOF)} measurement (right). The TOF estimator used here is
computed using the first ten calorimeter hits in the Ecal that are closed to the extrapolation of the particles momentum into the calorimeter, assuming
an individual time resolution of $100$~ps per hit\footnote{While this time resolution seems realisticly possible, it has to be noted that so far it has
not yet been demonstrated in a test beam prototype.}.

  \begin{itemize}
   \item 4\,ab$^{-1}$ at 500\,GeV, with $f(-+,+-,++,--) = (40\%,40\%, 10\%, 10\%)$
   \item 8\,ab$^{-1}$ at 1\,TeV, with $f(-+,+-,++,--) = (40\%,40\%, 10\%, 10\%)$.
\end{itemize}
\item benchmarks chosen to illustrate many performance aspects, not to cover complete physics case
\item analyses not optimised for utmost physics performance
\item in general DBD sample based analyses remain valid for physics
\item list of produced samples ?
