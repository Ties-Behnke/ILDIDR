\chapter{Detector and Physics Performance}
\label{chap:performance} 
\label{ild:sec:performance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The overall performance of the ILD detector is a combination of the excellent
resolutions and efficiencies of the individual sub-detectors and the
sophisticated reconstruction and analysis algorithms described in the previous chapter.
Here we review this performance, beginning with the pure system performance that
is achieved from reconstructing individual long lived particles, followed by the high-level
reconstruction of jets and physics objects, ending with selected detector physics benchmarks.
Where applicable this performance is presented for the large (IDR-L) and the small (IDR-S)
detector model. Unless stated otherwise, the silicon based readout option for the ECal and the
scintillator based readout option for the HCal of the hybrid simulation described in section~\ref{sec:hybrid-sim}
have been used in the event reconstruction.
