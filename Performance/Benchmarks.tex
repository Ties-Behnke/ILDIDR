\subsection{General Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item all benchmarks at 500\,GeV or even 1\,TeV since more challening for detector
\item Luminosity and polarisation according to H20 / running scenario paper: 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item 4\,ab$^{-1}$ at 500\,GeV, with $f(-+,+-,++,--) = (40\%,40\%, 10\%, 10\%)$
   \item 8\,ab$^{-1}$ at 1\,TeV, with $f(-+,+-,++,--) = (40\%,40\%, 10\%, 10\%)$.
\end{itemize}
\item benchmarks chosen to illustrate many performance aspects, not to cover complete physics case
\item analyses not optimised for utmost physics performance
\item in general DBD sample based analyses remain valid for physics
\item list of produced samples ?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hadronic Branching Ratios of the Higgs Boson}
\begin{itemize}
\item main physics observables: $\sigma(\nu\bar{\nu} H)\times BR(H\to b\bar{b} / c\bar{c} / gg)$
\item cross-section and/or generator level numbers ? 
\item brief analysis description: precuts, MVA, template fit
\item example MVA input: 
  \begin{itemize}
     \item reconstructed $M_H$ for large and small, signal and backgrounds. 
     \item possibly in addition also separately for $\nu\nu bb$ final state?
     \item and/or with cheated neutrinos in jets / perfect PFA / ...?
  \end{itemize}
\item example flavour tag: 
  \begin{itemize}
     \item full sim templates for $H \to bb / cc / gg$ (2D colz instead of lego?)
     \item cheated and artificially bad performance
  \end{itemize}
