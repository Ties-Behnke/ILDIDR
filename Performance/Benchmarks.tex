\fix{Each benchmark has its own confluence page, where a lot more material, including the draft of the ILD note and the names of the main analysis reponsibles can be found: {\small \url{https://confluence.desy.de/display/ILD/Benchmarks+for+physics-driven+detector+optimisation}} 
Note that several benchmark are still work in progress. A short comment at the beginning of each section gives a rough summary of the status.}

The performance of the two ILD detector models IDR-L and IDR-S has been
evaluated on a number physics benchmarks, which will be discussed in this section. Despite the fact that a 250-GeV version of the ILC is currently under political consideration in Japan, the detector benchmarking has been performed at higher center-of-mass energies, mostly at 500\,GeV, and in one case even at 1\,TeV. This choice has been made in order to make sure that both detector models perform adequately also under the more challenging experimental conditions of the higher energy stages, and in order to cover e.g.\ a wider range of jet, lepton and photon energies.

Unless stated otherwise, all results have been scaled to the integrated luminosity and beam polarisation of the full H20 running scenario originally defined in~\cite{Barklow:2015tja}, which is --- for the higher center-of-mass energies --- unchanged since~\cite{Bambade:2019fyw}. In particular, the H20 scenario comprises 4\,ab$^{-1}$ at 500\,GeV, with beam polarisation absolute values of 80\% for the electron and 30\% for the positron beam. The total luminosity is shared between the different polarisation sign combinations according to $f(-+,+-,++,--) = (40\%,40\%, 10\%, 10\%)$. 
Analoguously, 8\,ab$^{-1}$ are considered at 1\,TeV, with absolute polarisation values of 80\% for the electron and 30\% for the positron beam, with the same $f(-+,+-,++,--) = (40\%,40\%, 10\%, 10\%)$ sharing.

The benchmarks presented in this section have been chosen to illustrate many performance aspects with a minimum number of benchmarks, and are not to meant to cover the {\em complete} physics case. The main focus of the analysis work was not always the pure optimisation for utmost physics performance, but rather to better understand and highlight the role of individual performance aspects and their interplay.

Unless stated otherwise, the analyses performed for and since the time of the ILC TDR remain valid in their physics message. For an up-to-date review of the ILC physics case, based on ILD detector simulations, see e.g.~\cite{Bambade:2019fyw}.

\subsection{Hadronic Branching Ratios of the Higgs Boson}
\fix{few open questions between Masakazu, Frank Simon and JL, see email June 25.}

The measurement of the hadronic branching ratios of the Higgs boson,
including in particular $H\to c\bar{c}$, is one of the unique items
on the menu of future $e^+e^-$ colliders. This crucially depends on 
an excellent flavour tag, c.f.\ Sec.~\ref{sec:perf:hlr:lcfi}, enabled
by vertex detectors with micrometer point resolution with a first layer placed as close as 1.4\,cm to the beam line.

As a benchmark, the $\nu \bar{\nu} H \to \nu \bar{\nu} jj$ final state was chosen in order to minimize the impact of other performance aspects like e.g.\ jet clustering. Thus the target physics observable here is $\sigma(\nu\bar{\nu} H)\times BR(H\to b\bar{b} / c\bar{c} / gg)$. With the full 500\,GeV data set, about 200000 $H \to b\bar{b}$ events would be produced in this final state alone, while about 30000 and 10000 $H \to gg$ and $H \to c\bar{c}$ would be available, respectively. In the 
limit of 100\% signal efficiency and zero background, this would correspond to statistical precisions of 0.2\%, 0.6\% and 1\% for $H \to b\bar{b}$, $H \to gg$ and $H \to c\bar{c}$, respectively.

The benchmark analysis is documented in detail in~\cite{ILDNote:Hbbccgg}, and follows earlier analyses~\cite{Mueller:2016exq,Ono:2013voc,Ono:2013sea}. The full performance of the ILC on Higgs branching ratio measurements, combining all final states,  can be found in~\cite{Bambade:2019fyw}. After a cut-based preselection, the kinematic selection of $\nu \bar{\nu} H \to \nu \bar{\nu} jj$ events is refined by a multi-variate approach. Up to this point, no flavour-tag information is used.
Figure~\ref{fig:Hbbccgg:mh} shows the distributions of the reconstructed Higgs mass at this stage of the analysis for the signal on top of the remaining SM backgrounds, comparing both detector models.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:Hbbccgg:likeli} shows the 2D distributions of $c$- vs $b$-likeliness (c.f.\ Sec.~\ref{sec:perf:hlr:lcfi})for the different Higgs decay modes. The ``data'' distribution is then fitted in 3D template approach in order to determine the contained fractions of the various hadronic Higgs decay modes, where the 3rd dimension is the $bc$-likeliness. Due to the limited available statistics of background MC, a much smaller number of bins than displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hbbccgg:likeli} was used~\cite{ILDNote:Hbbccgg}. The resulting precisions from this template fit are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hbbccgg:BR}. Thereby, Fig.~\ref{fig:Hbbccgg:BR:cheat} compares the actual results for IDR-L and IDR-S with the $P(e^-,e^+)=(-80\%,+30\%)$ data only with the  result obtained for a perfect flavour tag. It shows that for $H \to b\bar{b}$ and $H \to gg$ the current flavour tag performance yields a close to perfect identification of these final states. For $H \to c\bar{c}$, however, the
real flavour tag performs worse by a factor of two. On the other hand, for a worse flavour separation, especially the expected precision for $H \to c\bar{c}$ degrades rapidly~\cite{ILDNote:Hbbccgg},
thus the performance of the ILD detector and reconstruction is crucial for the ability to measure $H \to c\bar{c}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:Hbbccgg:BR:LS} finally compares the precisions from all data sets combined for IDR-L and IDR-S. It shows a rather equivalent performance of both detector models. In the case of $H \to c\bar{c}$, which is most sensitive to the detector performance, the smaller detector model actually performs a little better due to its stronger magnetic field and the resulting better momentum resolution in the forward region, c.f.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:perf:trkres}.

\subsection{Higgs Mass from \texorpdfstring{$ZH \to ll b\bar{b}$}{ZH -> llbb}}
\fix{IDR text and plots okayed by Frank Simon(referee). Main missing item: complete note.}

The single most precise method to measure the Higgs mass is the recoil analysis at $\sqrt{s}=250$\,GeV~\cite{Yan:2016xyx}. At $\sqrt{s}$ much higher than the $ZH$ production threshold, the recoil
technique suffers substancially from the increasing amount of ISR and beamstrahlung. In addition, the momenta of the muons from $Z\to \mu\mu$ increase in magnitude and thus are measured less precisely. Still, the data collected at higher centre-of-mass energies can be exploited effectively when using the fully-reconstructable decay modes of the Higgs boson in combination with kinematic constraints from the known initial state. E.g.\ the constraints $\sum_i{p_{i_y}}=0$ and $\sum_i{p_{i_x}}=3.5$\,GeV\footnote{In $x$ direction the inital momentum is not zero due to the crossing angle of the beams, but given by $\sqrt{s} \cdot \sin{14\,\mathrm{mrad}}$.} can replace the measured energies of the Higgs decay products, so that only on the {\it angles} of the Higgs decay products and the momenta of the muons from $Z\to\mu^+\mu^-$ enter in the mass reconstruction. Thus the technique is independent of systematic uncertainties as e.g.\ associated with the $b$-jet energy scale. The detailed description of the technique can be found in~\cite{ILDNote:MH}.

The resolutions on the kinematic quantities which enter the Higgs mass reconstruction, namely azimuthal and polar angles of the jets and the muon energy, are compared in Figs.~\ref{fig:mh:res:phi_LS} and~\ref{fig:mh:res:etheta} for IDR-L and IDR-S. For this, 
the jet angles obtained from clustering the MC particles after hadronisation serve as truth reference, so that the detector performance is singled out from other influences.  Figure~\ref{fig:mh:res:phi_hadronisation} illustrates the effect of hadronisation by comparing to the quark-level direction taking IDR-L as example. It shows that the detector resolution (blue histogram, same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:mh:res:phi_LS}) is comparable, but
subdominant to the hadronisation effect (red histogram). While the angular resolutions are very similar for both detector models, the muon energy resolution is worse for the small detector, reflecting the somewhat worse $p_t$ resolution for high-momentum tracks in the central region of the detector, c.f.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:perf:trkres}.

Figure~\ref{fig:mh:mass} shows the propagation of this effect to the actual physics observable, i.e.\ the reconstructed mass of the Higgs candidates. IDR-L and IDR-S are compared for the muon channel in Fig.~\ref{fig:mh:mass:mumu} and for the electron channel in Fig.~\ref{fig:mh:mass:ee}. In both cases signal and all backgrounds from the SM and other $ZH$ modes are combined, with clear peaks visible around the nominal Higgs and $Z$ boson masses. In particular in the muon channel, the worse momentum resolution of the small detector leads to the peaks being visibly wider. The uncertainty on the Higgs mass is extracted by fitting these distributions following the approach used for the recoil analysis~\cite{Yan:2016xyx}. This results in an uncertainty on the measured Higgs mass of $66$\,MeV in the case of IDR-L and $81$\,MeV for IDR-S, to an increase of about $22\%$.

\subsection{Branching Ratio of \texorpdfstring{$H \to \mu^+\mu^-$}{H -> mm}}
\fix{IDR text and plots signed off by Ivanka and Filip (referees), note send for circulation in ILD! :-) :-) :-)}

In the SM, the decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of muons is a very rare decay, with a branching ratio of $2.2 \times 10^{-4}$. In order to identify this small signal, the achievable mass resolution, thus the precision to which the momenta of the two muons are measured, plays a crucial role. For the purpose of detector benchmarking, we consider only 
$\sigma(\nu\bar{\nu} H)\times BR(H\to \mu^+\mu^-)$ as observable, which isolates best the effect of the muon momentum resolution.

The selection~\cite{ILDNote:Hmumu} targets events with substancial missing four-momentum plus 
two well-reconstructed, oppositely charged muons. Kinematic and angular variables are exploited in an MVA analysis. Figure~\ref{fig:Hmumu:mass} shows the di-muon invariant mass distribution for all selected signal events. In case of the small the detector model, the mass peak is about $10\%$ wider than for the large detector. This originates from the combination of the muons from the Higgs decay being high-energetic and rather central, plus the better momentum resolution of the large detector for high-momentum tracks in the barrel. 
This effect is seen more clearly in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hmumu:sigma}, which compares the event-by-event resolution of the di-muon invariant mass for the selected signal events with both muons in the barrel region of the detector ($|\cos{\theta}| < 0.7$). 


For the $500$\,GeV data set of the H20 scenario, the asymptotic precision on cross section times cbrnaching ratio for the case of $100\%$ efficiency and no backgrounds would be 13\%.  
\begin{figure}[htbp]

}
\label{fig:Hmumu}
\end{figure}

After the event selection, about $33$ signal events, corresponding to a selection efficiency of $58\%$, remain over a evenly distributed background of about $1100$ events (counted in a mass window between $120$ and $130$\,GeV). Finally, the expectation values for the number of signal events observable above the backgrounds as well as for its uncertainty are obtained from many toy MC fits to the di-muon invariant mass spectrum~\cite{ILDNote:Hmumu}. The obtained precisions on $\sigma(\nu\bar{\nu} H)\times BR(H\to \mu^+\mu^-)$ are $40.2$\% for IDR-L and $41.3$\% for IDR-S. The relative difference of $2.8$ is consistent with the expectation of a $\sim 10\%$ difference in the signal peak width over a flat background. Either number, however, is about a factor $3$ worse than the asymptotic precision for the case of $100\%$ efficiency and no backgrounds, which would be 13\%. The difference is wastly dominanted by the remaining ``irreducible'' backgrounds with two muons and two neutrinos from $W$ pairs decaying either directly to muons or via tau-leptons. While there is certainly room for improvement in rejecting these backgrounds, this will factorize from the impact of the signal peak width, as long as the background remains flat in the discriminating variable.

\subsection{Sensitivity to \texorpdfstring{$H \to $ invisible}{H -> invisible}}
\fix{Yu and Marcel (referee) okayed IDR draft, note incomplete}

The decay of the Higgs boson into invisible particles is of particular interest because
it could give important clues about the nature of Dark Matter. As a detector benchmark for testing the impact of the jet energy resolution, in particular the hadronic decay mode of the $Z$ boson is considered here. Thus the physics observable will be the upper limit on $\sigma(q\bar{q} H)\times BR(H \to \mbox{inv.})$.

The event selection~\cite{ILDNote:Hinv} targets events which are consistent with  a di-jet plus missing four-momentum topology, where the di-jet invariant mass should be compatible with the $Z$ boson mass. The jet finding step also serves to reject PFOs from overlay of $\gamma\gamma \to $ low-$p_t$ hadron events. The final discriminating variable is the
invariant mass of the ``invisible'' four-momentum recoiling against the $Z$ boson.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:Hinv:cheat:mjj} shows the di-jet invariant mass for the selected signal events at various levels of realism from the full reconstruction to cheating everything but the detector and particle flow performance. The first step of partial cheating removes jets with semileptonic heavy flavour decays. In a detector like ILD shower shapes in the highly-granular calorimeter and specific energy loss information from the TPC should allow an
excellent identification of leptons in jets, which, combined with secondary vertex information
should allow to significantly improve scale and resolution for heavy flavour jets with semileptonic decays. However, the corresponding reconstruction algorithms are still under development and thus could not be applied here. Similarly, work is ongoing to improve the
removal of overlay backgrounds, see e.g.\ Sec.~\ref{subsec:bench:higgsino} and Ref.~\cite{Boronat:2014hva}. Thus, we expect that with future reconstruction improvements, a performance similar to the case ``w/o sld and overlay'' could be reached. The beam spectrum (BS) by construction does not affect the invariant di-jet mass. ISR, on the contrary, can lead to photons in the detector. In this analysis, no attempt has been made to identify the corresponding particle flow objects. Therefore, also a large part of the effect of ISR on the di-jet mass should be recoverable with a more sophisticated analysis. 

The corresponding situation for the recoil mass is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hinv:cheat:mrec}.
Here, ISR and BS have a large impact since they lead to a deviation of the actual initial state of the hard interaction from the naive assumption. Since this effect is dominated by photons from ISR and BS which escape undetected along the beam pipe, no attempt has been made to correct the kinematics of those events in which a photon is detected. See e.g.\ Sec.~\ref{subsec:bench:extraH} for an analysis where such a correction is applied. 

The recoil mass distributions obtained with the large and small detector model are compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hinv:comp}. Thereby, Fig.~\ref{fig:Hinv:comp:mrec} shows the situation at the current full reconstruction level, while Fig.~\ref{fig:Hinv:comp:cheatmrec} cheats the effect of semi-leptonic decays, overlay removal, beam spectrum and ISR. In both cases, the recoil  mass is slightly shifted to higher values in case of the small detector, due to differences 
in the calibration of the particle flow for the two models. In addition, the cheated recoil mass distribution is a bit wider for the small detector, as expected from its slightly worse
JER, c.f.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:perf:pfa_jer}.

\label{fig:Hinv:BRlimit}
\end{figure}

The results in terms of the physics observable, namely the $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on $\sigma(q\bar{q} H)\times BR(H \to \mbox{inv.})$, are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hinv:BRlimit} for both detector models at the various cheating levels. In the case of full reconstruction, the upper limit is at 0.78\%  for IDR-L  and at  0.79\%  for IDR-S, corresponding to a relative change of about 1\%. At when isolating the effect of the particle flow performance by cheating all other aspects, the limit would be 0.50\% (0.51\%) for IDR-L (IDR-S), i.e.\ a relative change of about 2\%. Also displayed is an estimate of how
the cheated results would change when scaling the JER up and down. This clearly shows that
larger variations of the JER, by 20\% or so, have a clear impact on this physics analysis.
In the case of $\sqrt{s}=250$\,GeV, the impact of ISR and BS is much smaller, increasing the relative contribution from the JER.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\tau$}{Tau} polarisation, \texorpdfstring{in $e^+e^- \to \tau^+\tau^-$}{in e+e- -> tau tau}}
\fix{a few open points between Daniel, Mikael (referee) and JL, note in very advanced state}

As shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:perf:hlr:tau}, the smaller ECAL inner radius of the small detector model slightly reduces the ability to identify the correct number of photons in
highly-boosted $\tau$ decays. Using the product of efficiency times purity as a figure of merit, this leads to a $5\%$ worse identification of $\tau \to \pi \nu$ and $\tau \to \rho \nu$ decays, while the identification of $\tau \to a_1 \nu$ decays deteriorates by about $15\%$ relative, c.f.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:HLR-tauID}. 

In order to evaluate the impact of this difference in a physics example, the measurement of the $\tau$ polarisation in $e^+e^- \to \tau^+\tau^-$ has been studied, looking specifically at events with no significant ISR, so those {\em not} returnin to the $Z$ pole. For the $\tau \to \pi \nu$ channels, the magnitude of the $\pi^{\pm}$ momentum can directly be used to extract the polarisation. In case of the $\tau \to \rho \nu$ decay, a polarimeter vector is constructed from the momenta of the $\pi^{\pm}$ and the $\pi^0$. A detailed description of the analysis and the polarisation extraction can be found in~\cite{ILDNote:tautau}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:tautau:taupol} illustrates the precision on the $\tau$ polarisation achieved with IDR-L and IDR-S  based on the $\pi$ and $\rho$ channels in the $P(e^-,e^+)=(-80\%,+30\%)$ data set, which dominates the combined precision. Thereby, various
levels of cheating are shown, starting from the optimal result when using all MC information, including the neutrino momentum. The next entry shows by how much the performance in the $\rho$ channel degrades by the approximate definition of the polarimeters used here\footnote{In principle, improved methods can be used, which however need further investigation~\cite{ILDNote:tautau}.}. The most significant effect occurs when reducing the number of signal events according to the selection efficiency of about $55\%$ 
observed in the full analysis \fix{[JL: under clarification with Daniel]}. The last three steps use the fully simulated and reconstructed events, apart from the entry ``cheat ECAL'', which uses MC information for the $\pi^0$ in the $\rho$ channel. In the last step, the full SM background is added. Overall, the differences between IDR-L and IDR-S are very small,  and probably due to limited MC statistics. The largest deterioration of the precision occurs when applying the selection efficiency. Thus, future improvements of the di-$\tau$ selection have the largest potential for improving this measurement.

\subsection{Hadronic \texorpdfstring{$WW$ and $ZZ$}{WW and ZZ} separation in Vector Boson Scattering} 
\fix{IDR draft okayed by Taikan (referee). Note awaiting addition of plots from new high-$Q^2$ samples and comments from Taikan, otherwise ready for circulation.} 

Vector boson scattering is an important process for testing the unitarisation of $WW$ scattering by the Higgs boson, as well as for measuring quartic gauge couplings, and thereby probing for anomalous contributions. Among all relevant final states, the reaction $e^+e^- \to \nu\nu VV \to \nu\nu qqqq$, where $VV$ can be $WW$ or $ZZ$, poses a particular challenge to the detectors and reconstruction algorithms, since it requires the separation of the hadronic $W$ and $Z$ decays without the ability to exploit kinematic constraints e.g.\ on the
total event energy due to the two invisible neutrinos.

This benchmark, at a center-of-mass energy of 1\,TeV, has already been studied in full detector simulation for the ILD LoI~\cite{ild:bib:ILDloi}. Now, we include for the first time all relevant aspects, in particular the full overlay from $\gamma\gamma \to$ low-$p_t$ hadrons and from $e^+e^-$ pair background, and we consider all quark flavours in the final state~\cite{ILDNote:QGCs}. The $W$ and $Z$ mass distributions obtained with the current full reconstruction are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qgc:rec}. Therein Fig.~\ref{fig:qgc:rec:1d} shows the average di-jet mass per event, comparing ILD-L and ILD-S, while Fig.~\ref{fig:qgc:rec:2d} shows the 2-dimensional distribution in the mass plane of the two invariant di-jet masses for ILD-L. At this level, no significant difference between the detector models can be observed.

Figure~\ref{fig:qgc:cheat} shows the analogous distributions obtained when cheating the jet clustering (incl.\ the overlay removal), the jet pairing and when excluding events with semi-leptonic decays of heavy quarks, so that only the effects of the natural widths of the bosons, of fragmentation and hadronisation as well as the JER itself remain. Also here, no striking difference between the models can be seen, which leads to the conclusion that on this event sample, which is dominated by events with rather low invariant masses of the di-boson system, the effect of the slightly worse JER of ILD-S is hidden beneath the width and fragmentation/hadronisation corrections.


Nevertheless, the differences between Fig.~\ref{fig:qgc:rec} and Fig.~\ref{fig:qgc:cheat} are striking. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the size of various contributions individually as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qgc:cheatWWZZ}, for ILD-L only. For the inclusive $WW$ and $ZZ$ samples, shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:qgc:cheat:WW} and~\ref{fig:qgc:cheat:ZZ}, the dominant effect is the residual of the non-perfect overlay removal, followed by the jet clustering itself and the semi-leptonic decays. Non-perfect jet pairing only plays a minor role. This can be compared to the situation found when only considering events with high $WW$/$ZZ$ invariant masses, shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:qgc:cheat:WWQ2} and~\ref{fig:qgc:cheat:ZZQ2}. In this case, the impact of non-perfect jet clustering is reduced to a negligible level. Instead, the effect of the residual overlay from low-$p_t$ $\gamma \gamma \to $hadron events dominates. For the $ZZ$ events, also the missing neutrinos from semi-leptonic heavy quark decays play a visible role. 
These results demonstrate the need for development of more sophisticated high-level reconstruction algorithms, in particular for the overlay removal, the jet clustering and the identification and correction of semi-leptonic heavy flavour decays. For all these cases promising tools are under development, see e.g.\ Sec.~\ref{subsec:bench:higgsino} and Ref.~\cite{Boronat:2014hva}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\fix{IDR draft signed off by Matthew (referee) and Takahiro. Note in a very incomplete state.}

Di-fermion production, with or without radiative return to the $Z$ pole, is an integral part of the ILC physics case. In addition, the radiative return events offer an important
opportunity to cross calibrate the energy scales of various subdetectors. As a detector benchmark, we chose here the example of calibrating the photon energy scale against the momentum scale of the tracker. Thereby, the momenta and angles of the muons as well as the 
polar and aziumuthal angle of the photon serve as input, from which the energy of the photon and the amount of energy lost in beamstrahlung and collinear ISR are determined by
requiring conservation of energy and $p_y$ between initial and final state. It should be stressed that it is not necessary to apply a $Z$ mass constraint, which would introduce an additional uncertainty due to the large natural width of the $Z$ resonance. A full description of this and alternative methods can be found in~\cite{ILDNote:gammaZ}.

Since the $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ sample
is dominated by radiative returns to the $Z$ pole, the majority of photons has high energies close to $241$\,GeV.

The resolution of angular method, i.e.\ the width of the blue distribution in Fig.~\ref{fig:gammaZ:meanE:allE} is shown for IDR-L and IDR-R in Fig.~\ref{fig:gammaZ:sigmaE:rel} as a function of the photon energy. This translates into
an absolute uncertainty on the photon energy scale calibration of about $10$\,MeV for high-energy photons, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gammaZ:sigmaE:abs}. 
The angular dependencies of the resolution of this method are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gammaZ:angles}. As a function of the polar angle, Fig.~\ref{fig:gammaZ:angles:theta} clearly shows the effect of the better momentum resolution of IDR-L for central high-momentum tracks, while in the two most forward bins, the small detector performs better due to its higher magnetic field. As a function of the azimuthal angle, there is no particular region where the performance of the two detector models differs, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:gammaZ:angles:phi}. The modulation of the resolution with $\phi$ is an effect of using the $p_y$ constraint only, which is the easiest method as the $p_y$ conservation is not influenced by the beam crossing angle. The modulation will be reduced when also $p_x$ balance is exploited e.g.\ in a kinematic fit.

The measurement of the left-right- and forward-backward asymmetries of $b$-quarks requires to distinguish the jet from the $b$-quark from the $\bar{b}$-jet. The two most important techniques for this are to reconstruct the charge of the secondary vertex, and to identify charged Kaons in the $b$-decay chain and exploit their charge. While the first method requires am as complete reconstruction of all tracks fomr the secondary vertices as possible, the Kaon ID hinges upon a special
feature of ILD, namely the measurement of the spefic energy loss $dE/dx$ in the TPC. In order to arrive at a reliable $b$-charge measurement, a consistent double-tag is required for each event, allowing for all four  possible combinations of the two techniques. All details of the event reconstruction and selection can be found in~\cite{ILDNote:bbtt}.

Figure~\ref{fig:bbbar:effipur:effi} compares the acceptance of the $b$-jet reconstruction for the large and the small version of ILD.
For $|\cos{\theta_b}|<0.5$, corresponding to a large part of the endcap 
region, the acceptance of IDR-L if about 1\% larger than for IDR-L.
\fix{[JL: do we understand why? Loss of soft tracks due to higher B-field?]} The purity of the four combinations of charge-ID (two methods times two jets) is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bbbar:effipur:pur}. While the charge-ID via vertex charge performs identically for both detectors, the Kaon-charge ID yields a higher purity for IDR-L due to the larger radius of the TPC, which improves the $dE/dx$ resolution.

Building on the $e^+e^- \to b\bar{b}$ benchmark described in the previous section, the analoguos study has also been performed for the case of $e^+e^- \to t\bar{t}$~\cite{ILDNote:bbtt}. So far, only the semi-leptonic channel has been analyzed, while the clean environment of a lepton collider in principle also allows to include the large statistics available in fully hadronic $t\bar{t}$ events. In order to prepare for the fully hadronic case, the vertexing and Kaon-ID based methods for charge identification have already been included in the analysis. The acceptances of the lepton-tag as well as of several double-tag combinations are compared for the large and small detector models in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbar:effi}. The single-tag based on the lepton charge (``$L_{\mathrm{cut}}$'') is 100\% efficient since the presence of a lepton is already required in the event selection. In fully hadronic $t\bar{t}$ events, only the double-tags without lepton information as shown in the first four bins, could be used, in analogy to the case of the $b\bar{b}$ analysis, c.f. Fig.~\ref{fig:bbbar:effipur:effi}.
While the size of the detector has no direct influence on the semi-leptonic analysis, both the vertex and Kaon-ID based methods are more efficient in case of the large detector.

Searches for additional Higgs bosons or other new scalar particles are theoretical well-motivated and highly
complementary to the sensitivity of hadron colliders. Due to the SM-likeness of the $125$-GeV Higgs boson, 
additional Higgs bosons are expected to have a suppressed coupling to the $Z$ boson. Nevertheless, they can 
be searched for using the same recoil technique which is the basis of the decay-mode independent measurement
of the total Higgsstrahlungs cross section. While in principle all visible decay modes of the $Z$ boson can
be exploited in this search, $Z\to\mu^+\mu^-$ as the cleanest mode has been chosen as a benchmark here~\cite{ILDNote:extraH}.
The two most important detector performance aspects for this analysis are the momentum resolution for the two
muons and the ability to detect and identify ISR photons in the detector. The latter applies in particular for the lower Higgs masses, where $M_h + M_Z << \sqrt{s}$ and thus significant photon radiation occurs frequently.
If the photon is detected, then the event kinematics can be corrected accordingly, improving the separation of signal and background significantly.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:extraH:Mdiff} shows the event-by-event difference between the reconstructed and generated di-muon mass for signal events with different Higgs masses as well as for the 2-fermion background. Since the underlying distributions in momentum and polar angle differ significantly, also the difference between IDR-L and IDR-S varies between the different samples. With higher Higgs masses, the $Z$ is less and less boosted, thus the muons are more and more central and back-to-back, resulting in an overall better mass reconstruction and a better performance of the large detector. In case of the $2$-fermion background, about half of the events returns to the $Z$ pole, resulting in forward boosted $Z$'s with a small opening angle between the also forward-going muons. In those events which do not return to the $Z$, the muons have higher momenta than in the
signal samples. In combination, the mass reconstruction in the $2$-fermion events is worse, but when comparing
the two detector models, the better momentum resolution of ILD-S in the forward region and its worse resolution
in the barrel roughly cancel.




This can be seen much more clearly from the event-by-event mass resolution as calculated from the errors on 
the track parameters, shown in Fig~\ref{fig:extraH:Msigma} for the same four event samples. In case of the Higgs
signal, the large detector always gives a significantly better resolution. In case of the $2$-fermion background, there is a population at the best resolutions which behaves like the signal, while at the worse
resolutions the small detector performs better than the large.

\label{subsec:bench:higgsino}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\fix{[physics performance still w.i.p., will be added after first circulation]}
New particles with maximally electroweak interactions and small mass differences in the decay chain are among the prime examples of discovery opportunities at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. A famous example of such kind of
new physics are higgsinos, which are expected to be light in natural SUSY models and tend to have small mass
splittings, in particular when the gaugino masses are much heavier. One of the model points studied previously in fast detector simulation~\cite{Berggren:2013vfa}, with a mass splitting of only $770$\,MeV between the chargino and the LSP, is used as a detector performance benchmark here~\cite{ILDNote:higgsinos}. The mass of the
chargino is about 167\,GeV.

Figure~\ref{fig:higgsino:trkeffi} shows the tracking efficiency as a function of transverse momentum as obtained
in these events at a center-of-mass energy of $500$\,GeV. For transverse
momenta below $p_t = 300$\,MeV, a clear difference can be seen between the two detector models due to the higher magnetic field of IDR-S. For this specific model point, which lies -- with $2 M(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1) \approx 330$\,GeV -- significantly below the kinematic limit, the efficiency to detect all charged decay products is around $60$\% and differs only by $2$\% between IDR-L and IDR-S, thanks to the sufficient boost of the charginos. For chargino masses closer to the kinematic limit, however, the typical $p_t$ will be even lower, 
and the difference visible in Fig~\ref{fig:higgsino:trkeffi} will lead to a larger effect.
The low $p_t$ tracking efficiency could be recovered at least partially by reducing the radii of the vertex detector layers for IDR-S, which is possible since the higher magnetic field also confines the pair background at smaller radii.

Figure~\ref{fig:WIMP:Ngamma} shows the ratio of recontructed and generated photons per event as a function of
the photon's energy and polar angle. While it has been shown in~\cite{Habermehl:2018yul} that the actual energy
resolution is not very critical in this analysis, it is important that the number of photons is correct, since the signature of a single photon and no other significant detector activity forms the basis of the selection.
As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:WIMP:Ngamma:E}, the average number of reconstructed photons per generated photon tends to be a few permille below 1 at low photon energies. With increasing photon energy, the tendency of the particle flow reconstruction to split a photon into two increases, but stays below the level of 3\%. Figure~\ref{fig:WIMP:Ngamma:theta} shows that these splits predominantly occur in the corner region between the
barrel and the endcap, which sits at different values of $\cos{\theta}$ for IDR-L and IDR-S due to the different
aspect ratios of the two detector models. The apparent inefficiency of about 1\% in case the small detector has been tracked to a correction in the reconstruction which has not been appropriatelty adjusted for the different aspect ratio of the small detector, which leads to the artefact that the PFOs exist, but are not recognized as photons by the particle flow. All the features in these two plots are expected to be reducable with further development of the particle flow reconstruction.

Figure~\ref{fig:WIMP:BCal} compares the number of reconstructed clusters in the BeamCal of the two detector models. Ideally, the $\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ events, which serve as proxy for the WIMP signal, should have no BeamCal cluster, while in case of the $e^+e^-\gamma$ events at least one BeamCal cluster should be found. Events with at least one cluster in the BeamCal will be rejected in the analysis. As expected, the probability to falsely reject a $\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ event is somewhat lower in case of the small detector, since the stronger
magnetic field confines the pair background to smaller radii.
