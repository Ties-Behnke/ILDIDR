\section{Overall structure of the detector}
\writer{Claude Vallee, Karsten Buesser}{1}

The geometrical structure of the ILD detector and the individual layouts of subdetectors were described in details in the ILD LOI [ref] and DBD [ref]. This section shortly reminds the main characteristics with emphasis on the recent evolutions and open options. The main design changes implemented since the DBD take into account continuous progress in detection technologies and the new optics of the ILC interaction region (chapter 3). In the following all dimensions are given for the large version of the detector (see section 4.2 for reduction factors of the small ILD).

The overall ILD detector structure is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:det:quad}: a high precision vertex detector positioned very close to the interaction point is followed by a hybrid tracking layout, realised as a combination of silicon tracking with a time projection chamber, and a calorimeter system. The complete system is located inside a large solenoid providing a nominal magnetic field of 3.5T (large ILD) or 4T(small ILD) . On the outside of the coil, the iron return yoke is instrumented as a muon system and as a tail catcher calorimeter. 
The main geometrical parameters are summarised in table~\ref{ild:tab:barrelpara} and table~\ref{ild:tab:endcappara}.

A key characteristics of the detector is the amount of material crossed by the particles: particle flow requires a thin tracker to minimise interactions before the calorimeter, and thick a calorimeter to fully absorb the showers and measure neutral hadrons. Figure~\ref{fig:det:material} shows the amount of radiation lengths of the trackers material and the total interaction lengths including the calorimeter system.

\subsection{Subdetector layouts}
\writer{Subdetector technical conveners}{4}

The current design of subdetectors is presented including open options and critical aspects, as well as prospects for enhanced capabilities in the future. The most recent progress and status of each detection technology will be summarized in section 5.2.

\vspace{1cm}
\subparagraph*{\bf Vertex detector}
\textit{(Besson, Ishikawa, Vos)}

The vertex detector (VTX, Figure~\ref{fig:det:vertex}) is realised as a multi-layer pixel detector with three double-layers. The detector has a pure barrel geometry. To minimise the occupancy from background hits,
the first double-layer is only half as long as the outer two. 



\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\hsize]{Detector/fig/vertex.png}
\caption{layout of the vertex detector.}
\label{fig:det:vertex}
\end{figure}

Critical parameters of the VTX optimisation are the point resolution for secondary vertex tagging, required to be better than 3$\mu$, and the material thickness which should not exceed 0.1\% $X_0$ per layer to minimize multiple scattering. Three main technologies are under consideration to achieve the required goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf CMOS pixels:} this well-established technology offers the advantages of high granularity with fully monolithic pixel digital electronics available from industrial processes. The most critical points of focus of current R\&D are the readout speed as it has single bunch tagging capacity, while keeping the power consumption low enough (with or without power pulsing) and the overall material budget of the layers.
    \item {\bf DEPFET pixels:} The DEpleted Field Effect Transistor (DEPFET) concept implements a first amplification stage in a FET in the high-resistivity, depleted silicon detector~\cite{}. Active pixel detectors with a rolling shutter read-out can meet the stringent requirements of the ILD vertex detector~\cite{Alonso:2012ss,Richter:2003dn}. This technology offers the advantage of high granularity with a small layer material thickness, the digital electronics being shifted at the end of the ladders: the all-silicon ladder design~\cite{Andricek:2004cj}, that is fully self-supporting and requires no external support, minimizes the material in the active area to approximately 0.12\% $X_{0}$. Critical aspects are the industrialisation of the fabrication process and the integration of large detector surfaces.
    \item{\bf Fine Pixel CCD (FPCCD):} CCD's offer the prospects for the highest granularities associated with low power consumption. Another advantage is the minimal material budget of the detector layer, however counter-balanced by the need of a cryostat to ensure low-temperature operation. Critical aspects under study are the readout speed and the resistance to radiation.  
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
The CMOS and DEPFET pixels have typical sizes of 20 microns and are readout in a continuous mode during bunch trains. The readout speed determines the capability to resolve individual bunches. The FPCCD pixels accumulate hits during one bunch train before readout and reset in-between trains. Their occupancy is kept acceptable thanks to a small pixel size of order 5 microns.  


\vspace{1cm}
\subparagraph*{\bf Silicon trackers}
\textit{(Besson, Vos, Vila)}

A system of silicon trackers surrounds the VTX detector. 

In the barrel, two layers of silicon detectors (SIT) are arranged to bridge the gap between the VTX and the TPC, and one silicon outer layer (SET) is foreseen inbetween the TPC and the ECAL. The baseline technology for the large area trackers was silicon strips but the progress made with CMOS detectors allow to equip the SIT with pixels instead of strips. The design of the SET is still open including the option to implement it as the first layer of the ECAL Calorimeter. The use of high resolution timing detectors is considered in order to provide a TOF functionality for particle identification. 

The forward tracking disks (FTD) complete the coverage of the ILD experiment for charged particles emitted at shallow angles with respect to the beam (Figure~\ref{fig:det:FTD}). The FTD provides at least one hit for tracks with polar angles below 35 degrees ($|\cos \theta| < $ 0.82) and provides nearly standalone tracking for tracks below 16 degrees ($|\cos \theta| <$ 0.96).

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.8\hsize]{Detector/fig/ILD_quadrant_2.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\hsize]{Detector/fig/FTD.png}
\caption{layout of the Forward Tracking Detector.}
\label{fig:det:FTD}
\end{figure}

The first two disks are installed close to the vertex detector and are equipped with highly granular pixel detectors that provide precise 3D space points with a resolution of approximately 3-5 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. The technology candidates for these disks are similar to those of the vertex detector: CMOS, DEPFET, FPCCD, SOI, and future 3D-integrated devices. 

The remaining five disks extend out to the inner envelope of the TPC at $r=$ 30 cm. While the requirement on the resolution of the $r\phi$ measurement remains stringent, the cell dimension aligned with the $r$-coordinate is less constrained. These requirements can be met with micro-strip detectors: two single-sided detector mounted under a small stereo angle may provide the required resolution. A solution based on CMOS monolithic pixel detectors with elongated pixels is likely to be quite competitive. Also the possibility o.f a Time-Of-Flight measurement in the outermost disks merits further study.

\vspace{1cm}
\subparagraph*{\bf TPC}
\textit{(Colas, Sugiyama)}

A distinct feature of ILD is a large volume time projection chamber (Figure~\ref{fig:det:TPC} left). The TPC allows a continuous 3-dimensional tracking, d$E$/d$x$-based particle identification and minimum material. The required performance of the TPC as a standalone tracker is a momentum resolution $\delta(1/P_T)$ better than $10^{-4} GeV^{-1}$, corresponding to a single point resolution of $100\mu$ over about 200 points, and a d$E$/d$x$ resolution better than 5\%. One critical issue concerns potential field distortions due to ion accumulation within the chamber. At ILC this can be mitigated by implementing an ion gating between bunch trains: ions produced in the gas amplification region during bunch trains are confined and eliminated outside bunch trains by reverting the electric field configuration. This can be implemented with GEM foils as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:det:TPC} right.

%\end{figure}
\label{fig:det:TPC}
%\begin{tabular}{cc}
\end{figure}

Three options are under consideration for the ionisation signal amplification and readout:
\begin{itemize}
    \item GEM readout (Figure~\ref{fig:det:TPC_readout} left): the ionisation signal is amplified by passing through a GEM foil and is collected on pads.
    \item Micromegas readout (Figure~\ref{fig:det:TPC_readout} right): the ionisation signal is amplified between a mesh and the pad array where it is collected.
    \item GridPix: the ionisation signal is amplified as for the Micromegas case but collected on a fine silicon pixel grid providing individual pixel timing.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}
For the GEM and Micromegas options, the typical pad sizes are a few mm (table~\ref{ild:tab:barrelpara}) and spatial resolution is improved by combining the track signals of several adjacent pads. For the GridPix option the pixel size of $\approx$50 microns matches the size of the mesh, providing pixel sensitivity to single ionisation electrons. The spatial resolution is improved and the dE/dx signal is measured by counting pixels or clusters.

\subparagraph*{\bf ECAL}
\textit{(Brient, Ootani)}

Electromagnetic showers are measured with a compact highly-segmented calorimeter (Figure~\ref{fig:det:ECAL}) which absorber planes are made of tungsten. The ECAL barrel shape is octagonal with individual stacks laid such as to avoid projective dead zones in azimuth. The baseline number of layers is 30, with options to reduce the number to 26 or even 22, keeping the amount of radiation lengths identical and increasing the thickness of the sensitive medium to maintain a similar energy resolution. 

\begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{Mechanical structure of the electromagnetic calorimeter: left: end-cap; centre: barrel; right: individual barrel module.}
\label{fig:det:ECAL}
\end{figure}

The sensitive medium consists in silicon sensors with about 5x5 $mm^2$ pads bonded on a PCB equipped with front-end readout ASICs (Figure~\ref{fig:det:ECAL_readout} left). In order to reduce the costs it is considered to equip part of the sensitive layers with scintillator sensors readout through SiPMs (Figure~\ref{fig:det:ECAL_readout} right). In that case the scintillator strips would have a larger dimension of 45x5$mm^2$ with alternate orthogonal orientation. The option to equip the first layer with high-resolution timing sensors is also under consideration to provide a TOF functionality.

\subparagraph*{\bf HCAL}
\textit{(Laktineh, Sefkow)}

The hadronic calorimeter consists in 48 longitudinal samples with steel absorber plates. Two options are currently considered for the mechanical structure, differing mainly in the barrel region (Figure~\ref{fig:det:HCAL}): the "TESLA" barrel made of 2 wheels with signals extracted longitudinally in the gaps between the barrel and endcaps, and the "VIDEAU" barrel made of 3 to 5 wheels with signals extracted at the periphery between the HCAL and coil cryostat. The latter presents no projective dead zone in azimuth nor at $90^o$ polar angle, and offers a better mechanical stiffness, at the cost of a reduced accessibility of the interfaces for data concentration and power supply.

\end{figure}

The HCAL layers are instrumented with high granularity for an efficient separation of charged and neutral hadronic showers, necessary for particle flow, as well as for a good muon identification for flavor jet tagging. Two sensor options are under consideration (Figure~\ref{fig:det:HCAL_readout}): scintillator tiles of 3x3 $cm^2$ with analog readout through SiPMs, and RPC's with pads of 1 $cm^2$ readout with a semi-digital resolution of 2 bits. A timing functionality is implemented in the scintillator option and under consideration for RPCs: a resolution of O(1ns) already achieved with the scintillator option allows to tag late neutral components of the showers for particle flow, whereas a resolution of a few 10 ps, also achievable with multigap RPCs, would provide TOF measurements.

\subparagraph*{\bf VFS}
\textit{(Benhammou, Schuwalow)}

The ILD very forward region is equipped with dedicated detectors to perform:
\begin{itemize}
\item a precise determination of the luminosity from Bhabha scattering electron pairs (LumiCAL);
\item an extension of the hadronic calorimetry coverage in the forward region (LHCAL);
\item calorimetric hermeticity down to the beam pipe and fast monitoring of beam conditions (BeamCAL).
\end{itemize}
The overall layout of the detectors is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:det:VFS} left. Their longitudinal positioning has been adapted as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:det:VFS} right to account for the new ILC optics (chapter 3).

\caption{Overal layout of the Very Forward detectors (left) and adaptations performed for the new ILC optics (right).}
\label{fig:det:VFS}
\end{figure}

The very forward detectors are based on similar technologies as the ILD electromagnetic calorimeter, taking into account the specific conditions of the forward region such as the harder radiation environment or the need for an improved compactness to identify electromagnetic showers in a high occupancy environment. For the detectors positioned closest to the beam pipe new sensors such as saphire are considered. The LumiCAL has the most advanced design and will be based on silicon sensors similar to the ECAL (Figure~\ref{fig:det:lumical}), with thinner instrumentation layers to minimize the lateral spread of the showers .

\subparagraph*{\bf Iron instrumentation}
\textit{(Saveliev)}

A large volume superconducting coil surrounds the calorimeters, creating an axial $B$-field of nominally 3.5 Tesla (large ILD) or 4 Tesla (small ILD). An iron yoke returns the magnetic flux of the solenoid, and, at the same time, serves as a muon filter, muon detector and tail catcher calorimeter. The baseline structure of the yoke is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:det:yoke} left for a configuration accounting for the maximum stray fields allowed in the push-pull configuration (chapter 3). Optimisation of the yoke size is ongoing to minimize the overal cost driven by the amount of iron. A number of iron yoke gaps will be instrumented for muon tracking and measurement of the tails of the hadronic showers. The required muon tracking precision is of the order of 1 cm in azimuth and of a few cm longitudinally. The instrumentation is expected to consist in scintillator bars but RPCs are also considered. In the scintillator option the light will be collected by Wave Length Shifting (WLS) fibers readout with SiPMs at both extremities (Figure~\ref{fig:det:yoke} right top). The WLS fibers will be positioned either in an extruded groove at the center of the large side of the bar, or along the small side of the bar (Figure~\ref{fig:det:yoke} right bottom).

\section{Subdetector technology status}
%\writer{Subdetector conveners}{}

%This section is one of the main technical added values of the IDR. It should summarize all technological progress since the DBD, including beam tests of technological prototypes and ongoing spinoffs. It should also indicate the remaining steps to fulfil the ILD requirements, with a focus of critical aspects associated to each technology choice. For conciseness only the highlights should be illustrated, with all details to be referenced in technical publications. As regards illustrations it is proposed to stick to o(1-2) photo and o(1-2) plot  for each technology. 

All ILD detector technologies under consideration have benefited from substantial developments since the DBD publication. Many activities are coordinated within worldwide R\&D Collaborations such as LCTPC [ref], CALICE [ref] or FCAL [ref]. Compared to the DBD studies, which were still focused on intrinsic physics response and performance, many technologies have now developed operational implementations with technological prototypes which are mature for extrapolation to a full detector. Applications have indeed already started with many spin-offs to existing experiments such as the high-luminosity LHC detector upgrades. The experience gained with these projects will be a strong asset to the final design and construction of ILD.
