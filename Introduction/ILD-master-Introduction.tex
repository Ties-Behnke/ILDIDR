The ILD detector is a proposed detector for an electron-positron collider for energies from 90~\GeV to about 1~\TeV. It has been developed over the last 10 years by an international team of scientists with the goal to develop and eventually propose a fully integrated detector for an electron-positron collider, in particular the international linear collider, ILC.

The ILD detector concept has been designed as a multi-purpose detector. It should deliver excellent physics performance for collision energies between 90~\GeV and 1~TeV. The ILD detector has been optimized to perform excellently at the initial  energy of 250~\GeV, while maintaining full physics capabilities at higher energies. 

 A central element of the design has been the capability of the detector to reconstruct precisely complex hadronic final states as well as events with leptons or missing energy in the final state. Thus precision detector elements such as vertex detectors are combined with a large volume time projection chamber for excellent tracking efficiency and a highly granular calorimeter, in an overall design philosophy called particle flow, developed for optimal overall event reconstruction. 

The fundamental ideas and concepts behind the ILD detector have been discussed in two previous documents, the letter of intent \cite{ild:bib:ILDloi} and the detailed baseline document, DBD \cite{ild:bib:ilddbd}. 

The ILD detector has been scrutinized by international group at different occasions. After the publication of the letter of intent \cite{ild:bib:ILDloi} an international expert team reviewed ILD alongside two other detector concept, the SiD \cite{bib:sid:loi} and the fourth detector concept \cite{bib:4th:loi}. SiD and ILD were both validated as potential candidate experiments at the ILC. 

In this document the current state of the design of the ILD detector is summarised. The technologies which are proposed for the different parts of the detector are introduced. An extensive benchmarking has been performed, to demonstrate the performance of the ILD detector. This has been done for two different detector implementations, a large and a smaller one. Both concepts are the result of an optimization effort, with several goals - cost effectiveness was foremost a criterion for the smaller one, ultimate performance for the larger model. 

A lot of the work presented in this report is based on detector R\&D work which has taken place over the last decade to develop the necessary technologies. 
This work has typically happened within dedicated R\&D collaborations, which are independent but maintain very close connections to ILD. All technologies selected by ILD for one of its subsystems have been proven experimentally to meet the performance goals, or to come very close. 

Developing a very powerful detector concept over a long period of time requires balancing cutting edge technologies, which might become available while the concept is being developed, with safe and sound solutions. ILD in many cases is pursuing more than one technological option, to remain flexible and to be able to adapt to new developments. The concept group  wants to remain open and flexible to be prepared to select the most modern and most powerful technology once it is necessary. 
However a distinction is made between options and alternatives: while options have undergone an extensive R\&D program and have passed critical proof-of-concept tests, alternatives are potentially interesting and promising technologies which have not matured to a similar level at the time of writing this document. 

The ILD group which is proposing this detector has currently some 70 member institutes from all around the world. The group has evolved into a proto-collaboration, which is positioning itself to move forward with a proposal for a detector at the ILC or other proposed electron-positron facilities.

The document starts with a short review of the science goals of the ILC, and how the goals can be achieved today with the detector technologies at hand. After a discussion of the ILC and the environment in which the experiment will take place, the detector is described in more detail. The integration of the different sub-systems into an integrated detector is discussed, as is the interface between the detector and the collider. This is followed by a concise summary of the benchmarking which has been performed in order to find an optimal balance between performance and cost. To this end the costing methodology used by ILD is presented, and a cost estimate for the detector is presented. The report closes with a summary of the proposed detector and its performance.
