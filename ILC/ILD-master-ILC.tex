\writer{Karsten Buesser, Keisuke Fujii}{3}

Overall ILC constraints (could be adapted from LoI introduction) 

Updated beam conditions since DBD: new L*, backgrounds, energy profile (main plots from machine study group).

Initial focus on 250 GeV with future upgrades to higher energies

Critical channels/issues at 250 GeV
